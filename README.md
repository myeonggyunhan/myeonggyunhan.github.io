## Local Development

1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
2. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/myeonggyunhan/myeonggyunhan.github.io.git`
3. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `make run`
4. View the website at http://0.0.0.0:8000/
5. Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve the website.

## Deploy
  
Just type `make deploy`
